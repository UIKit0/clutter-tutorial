	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Put all the text in a sect1 instead of just at 
	the start of a chapter or appendix. Otherwise people will often jump straight past 
	it to the example if the example is the only thing listed in the table of contents.

2007-12-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/custom_actor/main.c: (main): Do not rotate the actor because 
	this obscures the example.
	* examples/custom_actor/triangle_actor.c: (clutter_triangle_paint):
	Paint a triangle with GL instead of a rectangle.

2007-12-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Effects section, Behaviours section:
	Mention the effects are a simple wrapper around Behaviours, and say when 
	they are not enough.
	Remind people to unref the effect template. 
	* examples/effects/main.c: (main): Unref the effect template.

2007-12-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/full_example/main.c: Limit angles to less than 360, 
	which seems to stop the last item from going around an extra time,
 	but sometimes other items go around an extra time instead.
	The calculations need to be cleaned up when this is working 
	properly.

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/effects/main.c: 
	Added an Effects chapter and example. I am not sure yet that I 
	see the advantage of Behaviours over Effects, and the 
	ClutterEffectsTemplate objects does not seem better than just 
	passing the timeline and alpha-callback to an effect function.

2007-12-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* AUTHORS: Corrected this.
	* TODO: Removed this.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Introduction: Mention that both 
	OpenGL or OpenGL ES may be used as the backend.

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml:

	* examples/custom_actor/Makefile.am:
	* examples/custom_actor/main.c:
	* examples/custom_actor/triangle_actor.c:
	* examples/custom_actor/triangle_actor.h: Added a custom actor 
	example by copying and simplifying ClutterRectangle. Described 
	the implementation. Still need to actually make it paint a 
	triangle though.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Behaviours: Mention that the 
	alpha callback will need to discover the timeline current and total 
	frames.
	Timelines: Give hints about the duration of a timeline.
	Mention unrefing of behaviours and timelines.
	* examples/behaviour/main.c: (on_alpha): Use the timeline. Now this 
	makes more sense.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/full_example/main.c: Made this slightly more useful, 
	trying to make a clicked image rotate to the front. 
	But clutter_behaviour_ellipse_set_angle_end() does not seem to 
	have the desired effect.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Introduction: 
	Mention that the examples are mostly unimpressive visually,
	on purpose, but that the full example should be more impressive.

	* examples/full_example/Makefile.am:
	* examples/full_example/README:
	* examples/full_example/images/
	* examples/full_example/main.c: Added the beginnings of a 
	very simple image browser.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Makefile_web.am_fragment: Add an html upload location on 
	openismus.com for now.
	* docs/index.html: Remove the maemomm content.
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Introduction: Rephrase - 
	Clutter is not really an extension of GTK+.
	Actors: Mention the floating reference.

2007-12-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Corrected the figure titles, 
	and fixed a markup typo.

	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/stage_widget.am:
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/stage_widget/main.c:
	Added a section and example to show the use of ClutterWidget and 
	clarified that a regular stage does not need GTK+.

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/timeline.png: Added timeline chapter 
	text and screeshot.
	* examples/timeline/main.c: (on_timeline_new_frame):
	Change the color too, to show that timeline callbacks are good 
	for changing more than one property (or more than one actor), 
	compared to a behaviour.

	of .cc files.

2007-11-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Wrote the installation text, 
	though this only mentions Ubuntu and will need to be updated 
	later for new clutter versions.

2007-11-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Added the expected document 
	structure and TODO text for each section.

2007-11-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/Makefile.am: Commented out the containers 
	example for now because they have been removed from clutter 
	and the new high-level clutter library does not exist yet.
	* examples/actor/main.c: (main):
	* examples/actor_events/main.c: (main):
	Replace use of deprecated clutter_actor_rotate_x() with 
	clutter_actor_set_rotation().
	* examples/timeline/main.c: (on_timeline_new_frame): 
	Replace use of removed clutter_enable_motion_events() 
	with clutter_set_motion_events_enabled().
