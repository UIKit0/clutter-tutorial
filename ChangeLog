	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Animations: Make it clear that apps 
	never need to use anything but the clutter_actor_animate() convenience 
	functions. Move the ClutterAlpha description here, from the Behaviours 
	chapter, because this is now the first mention. Remove mention of 
	removed standard ClutterAlpha callbacks.

2009-04-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

2008-06-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Removed the mention of the single-stage 
	limitation because this was fixed in 0.7/0.8.

2008-06-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Hopefully made the explanation of

	layout system introduced in clutter 0.7.

	* examples/custom_container/examplebox.c (example_box_remove,
	  example_box_pack): Call clutter_actor_queue_relayout instead of the
	custom layout function.
	  (example_box_get_preferred_width,
	  example_box_get_preferred_height): Use the new layout system to
	implement a width for height geometry management.
	  (example_box_allocate): Move the layout algorithm
	into the allocation function and use the new layout system to get
	the preferred size of the child actors and to set their position.
	  (example_box_init): Set geometry management to "width for height".
	* examples/custom_container/examplebox.h: Remove unused allocation
	store.
	* examples/custom_container/main.c (main): Use preferred container size.
	* examples/full_example/main.c (rotate_all_until_item_is_at_front):
	Fix a typo.
	* examples/multiline_text_entry/multiline_entry.c
	  (example_multiline_entry_allocate,
	  example_multiline_entry_class_init): Implement virtual allocate
	function instead of the old request_coords function.
	* examples/scrolling/scrollingcontainer.c
	  (example_scrolling_container_pack,
	  example_scrolling_container_remove,
	  example_scrolling_container_scroll_left): Call
	clutter_actor_queue_relayout instead of the custom layout function.

	* examples/actor_events/main.c (main): Fixed comment.
	* examples/custom_actor/triangle_actor.c (do_triangle_paint): Removed

	* examples/full_example/main.c (scale_texture_default, load_images):
	Use new 0.7 ClutterTexture functions to load the texture from file.

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Text Editing appendix: 
	Add a note that the pango_clutter() function is not public API,

0.2.0:

2008-03-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Fixed some typos.

2008-03-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Multiline Text Entry appendix:

	* examples/multiline_text_entry/multiline_entry.c:
	* examples/multiline_text_entry/multiline_entry.h: Simplified some more,
 	and added some comments. Did not find a way to implement up/down 
	cursor navigation.

2008-02-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/entry/: Added an example of ClutterEntry, though there 
	is no text about this yet.
	* examples/multiline_text_entry/: Added the start of a multi-line 
	example for the appendix, by cutting down ClutterEntry.

2008-02-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	Added text to the Scrolling appendix.
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/scrolling/Makefile.am:
	* examples/scrolling/main.c:
	* examples/scrolling/scrollingcontainer.c:
	* examples/scrolling/scrollingcontainer.h:
	A simple scrolling example. This is very possibly horribly wrong, 
	but this is how I will find out.

2008-02-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Removed the Using OpenGL Directly 
	appendix because it is covered by the Custom Actor section.

	* docs/tutorial/Makefile.am: Generate a PDF.

2008-02-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* examples/custom_actor/Makefile.am: distcheck fixes.
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Actor sections: Mention the anchor 
	point.
	Effects section: Show the AlphaFunc diagram from the API reference.
	Behaviour section: Show the AlphaFunc+Path diagram from the API 
	reference.
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am: Added the diagrams from 
	the API reference.

2008-02-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Correct some mentions of widgets to 
	mentions of actors.
	Custom Actor section: Explain pick().
	Custom Container section: Say what the example does and say what a 
	real container should probably offer.
	* examples/custom_actor/triangle_actor.c: 
	* examples/custom_container/examplebox.c: Implement pick().

2008-02-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Custom containers section: 
	Mention that pick() should pick each of its children, and refer to 
	the Custom Actor section for more details. However, I do not actually 
	have those details yet.

2008-02-26  Murray Cumming, <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Custom containers section:
	Mentioned overriding ClutterActor::paint() to paint children.
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am: Added a screenshot of the custom 
	container.
	* examples/custom_container/examplebox.c: Do not implement 
	ClutterActor::pick() because it is not necessary for a simple example.

2008-02-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Custom Containers section:
	mention vfuncs for doing layout of children.
	* examples/custom_container/examplebox.c:
	(example_box_query_coords), (example_box_request_coords),
	(layout_children):
	* examples/custom_container/examplebox.h:
	* examples/custom_container/main.c: Do not ignore the provided x1 and 
	y1 for the container.

2008-02-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/custom_container/examplebox.c:
	* examples/custom_container/main.c:
	Improve the implementation, iterating over the children every time we 
	should relayout the children.
	But the position of the container itself always seems to be 0. Possibly 
	I do not understand allocation/position or both.

2008-02-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	* examples/custom_container/Makefile.am:
	* examples/custom_container/examplebox.c:
	* examples/custom_container/examplebox.h:
	* examples/custom_container/main.c: Very cut-down version of 
	the old ClutterHBox container. Needs more work to make it behave 
	properly and be easier to understand.

2008-02-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/actor_group/: Added actors/containers sub-section, 
	mentioning ClutterGroup.

	* examples/custom_container/: Added placeholder for a custom 
	containers section and example.

2008-02-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac: Depend on clutter-0.6 and clutter-gtk-0.6 instead 
	of the -0.5 APIs.

2008-02-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/score/main.c: Added a Timelines/Score sub-section and 
	example. The example is quite stupid.

2008-02-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/stage_widget/main.c: (main):
	Use gtk_widget_set_size_request(gtkclutterembed) instead of 
	clutter_actor_set_size(stage) because the latter is not supported 
	with GtkClutterEmbed.
	See http://bugzilla.openedhand.com/show_bug.cgi?id=740

2008-02-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/actor_events/main.c: (on_stage_button_press),
	(on_rect_button_press), (on_rect_button_release), (on_rect_motion),
	(on_rect_enter), (on_rect_leave):
	* examples/full_example/main.c: (on_texture_button_press):
	* examples/stage/main.c: (on_stage_button_press):
	* examples/stage_widget/main.c: (on_button_clicked),
	(on_stage_button_press):
	Correct the event signal handlers: They should return gboolean instead 
	of void. C is overly tolerant of my mistakes.

2008-02-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Using Timelines: Change the X to a /
	in the description of duration. Thanks to Ashwin Kashyap.

2008-01-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Introduction: Remove the term 2.5D.
	Actor Basics: Change 2.5D term to 2D surfaces in 3D space.

2008-01-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Change mentions of GtkClutter to GtkClutterEmbed.
	* examples/stage_widget/main.c: (main): Use the new GtkClutterEmbed instead of the 
	old (removed) GtkClutter widget.
	* examples/full_example/main.c: (on_timeline_rotation_completed):
	Adapt to the new signature of the clutter_behaviour_scale_new() function.

2008-01-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Actor transformations: Use the correct example code.
	Thanks to Ashwin Kashyap.

2007-12-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Effects: Mention optional timeline cloning when using effects.

2007-12-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Actors: Added clipping sub-section, after talking to Ebassi.

2007-12-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Corrected the events chain sections, now explaining the 
	capture-event signal. 

2007-12-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Introduction: Mention that it is 
	a retatained mode API, though that would be obvious if you already knew what 
	that meant.
	Mention that timelines and behaviours use callback functions of time to change actor properties. 
	I don't see much more that we can say about these without reallying getting into the details, 
	which we do in the relevant chapters.
	Actors: Mention show/hide.
	Actors: Events: Describe false/true return value and the sequence of actors that handle events.
	Effects, Behaviours: Mention CLUTTER_ALPHA_MAX.
	
	These changes are based on the notes from Matthew Allum.

2007-12-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Actor Events: 
	motion events are now on by default, so rephrase.
	* examples/actor_events/main.c: (main):
	* examples/full_example/main.c: (main):
	Don't bother calling clutter_set_motion_events_enabled(TRUE);

2007-12-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Timelines, Behaviours: Mention the 
	ClutterTimeline::completed signal, which you should handle when you want 
	to unref timelines and behaviours as soon as possible.

2007-12-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Behaviours: ClutterAlpha _does_ have a a 
	floating reference.
	* examples/full_example/main.c: (add_to_ellipse_behaviour),
	(on_timeline_rotation_completed): Do not unref the ClutterAlpha because it has a 
	floating reference. 

2007-12-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/style.css: Make the header pink with black text, to be slightly 
	more like the default gtk-doc style.
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Full Example: Added a description of what it does.
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/: Added full_example.png.
	* examples/full_example/main.c: Make the background gray. Add a white rectangle under 
	the ellipse to give more sense of 3D. This is still rather ugly.

2007-12-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/full_example/main.c: Gradualyl show a label with the filename 
	when showing the item. I could make this more attractive when we have 
	container actors again. 

2007-12-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/behaviour/main.c: (main):
	* examples/effects/main.c: (main):
	* examples/timeline/main.c: (main): unref the timeline when the mainloop 
	stops.
	* examples/full_example/main.c: Avoid using even 360 degrees (not just >360) 
	to avoid an extra rotation of some items. Move and scale the clicked item 
	when the rotation stops.

2007-12-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Contributing: 
	Correct the email address.
	Timelines: Mention behaviours and actors, while 
	still avoiding trying to explain them all in one 
	paragraph, because each chapter explains the advantage 
	compared to the previous one. I don't want to confuse 
	people with too many concepts too quickly.
	Actor Events: Mention 
	clutter_set_motion_events_enabled() and 
	clutter_actor_set_reactive().
	Thanks to Tommi Komulainen for the suggestions.

2007-12-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Behaviours: 
	List the standard behaviours.

2007-12-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/actor_transformations/main.c: (main):
	Added this example.
	* examples/actor/main.c: (main): Removed the 
	rotation from this example.
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Actors: Added a 
	transformations sub-section.
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/: Added screenshots for 
	actor_events and actor_transformations.

2007-12-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	Added docs/tutorial/figures/custom_actor.png

2007-12-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Put all the text in a sect1 instead of just at 
	the start of a chapter or appendix. Otherwise people will often jump straight past 
	it to the example if the example is the only thing listed in the table of contents.

2007-12-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/custom_actor/main.c: (main): Do not rotate the actor because 
	this obscures the example.
	* examples/custom_actor/triangle_actor.c: (clutter_triangle_paint):
	Paint a triangle with GL instead of a rectangle.

2007-12-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Effects section, Behaviours section:
	Mention the effects are a simple wrapper around Behaviours, and say when 
	they are not enough.
	Remind people to unref the effect template. 
	* examples/effects/main.c: (main): Unref the effect template.

2007-12-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/full_example/main.c: Limit angles to less than 360, 
	which seems to stop the last item from going around an extra time,
 	but sometimes other items go around an extra time instead.
	The calculations need to be cleaned up when this is working 
	properly.

2007-12-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml:
	* docs/tutorial/figures/Makefile.am:
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/effects/main.c: 
	Added an Effects chapter and example. I am not sure yet that I 
	see the advantage of Behaviours over Effects, and the 
	ClutterEffectsTemplate objects does not seem better than just 
	passing the timeline and alpha-callback to an effect function.

2007-12-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* AUTHORS: Corrected this.
	* TODO: Removed this.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Introduction: Mention that both 
	OpenGL or OpenGL ES may be used as the backend.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/custom_actor/triangle_actor.c:
	* examples/custom_actor/triangle_actor.h: Added a custom actor 
	example by copying and simplifying ClutterRectangle. Described 
	the implementation. Still need to actually make it paint a 
	triangle though.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Behaviours: Mention that the 
	alpha callback will need to discover the timeline current and total 
	frames.
	Timelines: Give hints about the duration of a timeline.
	Mention unrefing of behaviours and timelines.
	* examples/behaviour/main.c: (on_alpha): Use the timeline. Now this 
	makes more sense.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/full_example/main.c: Made this slightly more useful, 
	trying to make a clicked image rotate to the front. 
	But clutter_behaviour_ellipse_set_angle_end() does not seem to 
	have the desired effect.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Introduction: 
	Mention that the examples are mostly unimpressive visually,

	* examples/full_example/Makefile.am:
	* examples/full_example/README:
	* examples/full_example/images/

	very simple image browser.

2007-12-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Makefile_web.am_fragment: Add an html upload location on 
	openismus.com for now.
	* docs/index.html: Remove the maemomm content.
	* docs/tutorial/clutter-tut.xml: Introduction: Rephrase -
